Alpha 0.1:

- Created the project

Alpha 0.2:

- Started working on the intro screen
- Added a whole bunch of sprites and (unused for now) audio
- Animated the first part of the intro

Alpha 0.3:

- Added Sprite Variants for the cells
- Game now allows for color variation depending on level
- Player can now draw on the cell grid (this was hell and back to make)
